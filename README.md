# Page Loader & Refresher
> A page loader/refresher that uses an ChromeDriver.                                                                  
This was mainly used for my GitHub but can be used to test your sites etc

# Setup
> 1) Clone this git repo.
> 2) ``Install modules from requirements.txt``.
> 3) Install verison `96.0.4664.45`chrome driver.
> 4) change `line 19` to your site or github page.

`OPTIONAL` If you are not using github, you can change `line 12` to how many times max it can refresh at one time. (Github spam is 70)
